# Anusharma - Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview
Building a professional, high-end website for "Anusharma," a fictional but realistic local business. The goal is a premium, "wow" factor design that could be pitched to a real owner.

## 2. Tech Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom styling with CSS Variables, Flexbox, and Grid.
- **JavaScript**: Smooth scrolling, animations, and form handling.

## 3. Features
- **Hero Section**: Full-screen immersive visual with "Anusharma" branding.
- **Experience Section**: Describing the ambiance and artisanal coffee.
- **The Menu**: Categorized menu (Coffee, Tea, Pastries) with price lists and descriptions.
- **Gallery**: A grid of beautiful café photos.
- **Reservations**: A clean, modern booking form mock-up.
- **Footer**: Location, hours, and social links.

## 4. Design System
- **Colors**: 
  - Primary: `#1A1A1A` (Deep Charcoal)
  - Secondary: `#F4F1EA` (Warm Bone)
  - Accent: `#D4AF37` (Soft Gold)
- **Typography**: 
  - Headings: 'Playfair Display' (Serif, Elegant)
  - Body: 'Inter' (Sans-serif, Modern)

## 5. Next Steps
1. Create `index.html` structure.
2. Build the CSS design system in `style.css`.
3. Implement interactivity in `script.js`.
4. Generate additional assets (Menu items, Interior shots).
